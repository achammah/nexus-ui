# record-core — the config-driven record system

Tables, boards, and record pages render FROM an `ObjectConfig` — a new entity is a config row, never a forked surface. This is the layer shadcn does not have; it is `rebuilt` (clean-room, PROVENANCE.md) and composes the vendored kit underneath.

## The object model (`src/record-core/types.ts`)

```ts
interface ObjectConfig {
  key: string;            // "companies" — route + API segment
  label: string;          // "Companies" (plural)
  labelOne: string;       // "Company"
  icon?: string;          // lucide name (consumer maps it)
  fields: FieldDef[];
  stageField?: string;    // a select field's key → enables the kanban
  defaultView: "table" | "kanban";
}
interface FieldDef {
  key: string; label: string;
  type: "text" | "number" | "select" | "date" | "currency" | "email" | "url"
      | "relation" | "user" | "multiselect"
      | "boolean" | "longText" | "dateTime" | "rating" | "array" | "json";
  options?: SelectOption[]; // select | multiselect — a string, or {value, label?, color?}
                            // (colors: gray/blue/green/yellow/orange/red/purple/pink/teal —
                            // chips render the color on every surface via OptionChip)
  unique?: boolean;         // 409 on duplicate values (server-enforced)
  isActive?: boolean;       // false → hidden from every surface + write-protected, data preserved
  scale?: number;           // rating scale (default 5)
  relation?: string;      // relation: target object key
  width?: number;         // table column px
  primary?: boolean;      // the display-name field (renders as the open-record link)
  primitive?: {           // AI-enrichment seam: the platform primitive computing this field
    kind: "task" | "workflow"; id?: string; label?: string;
  };
}
```

Field-type behaviors (all built-in): `select` renders as text-that-edits in tables (no per-row chrome) and a real select on record pages; `number`/`currency` format with grouping + right-align (tabular numerals); `relation` renders as an accent LINK that navigates to the target object's list, pre-filtered to the value (the consumer passes the pending filter via `sessionStorage["nx-pending-q"]` — see the starter's ObjectView); `user` renders an avatar-initials chip in tables and a directory combobox (over the consumer's `users` list) on record pages; `multiselect` renders tag chips (+N overflow) in tables and a checkbox popover on record pages, filtering contains-any; `boolean` is an inline checkbox everywhere; `rating` renders clickable stars (click the current value to clear); `dateTime` edits via a datetime-local input on the record page; `array` is free-form tags (no fixed vocabulary — type + Enter adds); `longText` truncates in tables and edits as a textarea; `json` is a validated raw editor; a select whose options carry colors renders as a COLORED CHIP in tables with an invisible native select on top (chip look, dropdown behavior).

## Components

| Component | Props (load-bearing) | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `DataTable` | `config, rows, onOpen(id), onPatch(id, patch), hiddenFields?, selection?, onSelectionChange?` | TanStack-powered grid: click-to-sort headers, primary-field link (`data-journey="open-<obj>"`), inline cell editing (text commit on blur/Enter; select on change; numbers formatted until focused), relation links, row checkboxes when `onSelectionChange` is passed, empty state; **auto-virtualizes past 80 rows** (windowed DOM via @tanstack/react-virtual, spacer rows, 70vh scroll container — journey-proven: 128 rows render <110 DOM rows while scroll reaches the last) |
| `KanbanBoard` | `config, rows, onPatch, onOpen, groupField?, groupOptions?` | columns from the group field's options (`groupField` defaults to `stageField` — pass any select/user field key to regroup; `user` fields need `groupOptions` = the app's directory since their columns aren't in `FieldDef.options`); dnd-kit drag commits `{[groupField]: column}`; card click opens; per-column counts; formatted meta |
| `ChartView` | `config, rows, groupField?, groupOptions?, measure?` | one bar per group option (same group semantics as the board: any select/user field, `groupOptions` supplies user columns); `measure` is `"count"` or a number/currency field key to SUM per group; value labels, hover emphasis, horizontal scroll past ~8 groups |
| `RecordPage` | `config, row, timeline, onPatch, onBack, onAddNote, relationOptions?, onOpenRelation?, related?, userOptions?, files?, onLogActivity?, onEnrich?` | header (name + stage badge + kind eyebrow) · left fields panel (inline edit per type; `date` → calendar popover writing `yyyy-mm-dd`; `user` → directory combobox; `multiselect` → chips + checkbox popover; a field with `primitive` + `onEnrich` shows a sparkle Run affordance) · right Tabs: Timeline (per-kind icons; optional call/email/meeting composer when `onLogActivity` is passed) / Notes / Files (upload + list + download when `files` is passed) |

`DataTable` sorting is optionally CONTROLLED (`sort` + `onSortChange`) so consumers persist it in their saved view; `hiddenFields` pairs with a consumer-owned column-visibility menu (the starter persists both per object in `nx-view-<obj>`). `date` cells render formatted (`14 Aug 2026`); editing dates lives on the record page.

`RecordPage` relation fields render a **picker** (command combobox over `relationOptions[fieldKey]` — the target object's primary values, consumer-fetched) with an optional jump button (`onOpenRelation`); pass `related: RelatedList[]` to render **related lists** (the reverse side of relations — the starter derives them from config: every object pointing at this one, filtered to this record). This pair is what makes an ATS/CRM-class app read as one.

`RecordPage`'s optional blocks all follow the same pattern — pass the prop to enable, omit it and the UI disappears: `watch: { on, count, onToggle }` renders the eye Watch button; `pin: { on, onToggle }` renders a star Favorite button (`data-testid="fav-toggle"`) — presentation only, the host owns storage (the starter keeps pins in localStorage and renders a sidebar shelf from them); `files: { list: FileMeta[], onUpload({name,mime,data}), downloadHref(fileId) }` adds the Files tab (base64 upload via a hidden input, list with size/date, download links); `onLogActivity(kind, text)` adds the segmented call/email/meeting composer to the Timeline tab (events carry `kind:"activity"` + `activity` subkind → per-kind icons); `onEnrich(fieldKey)` arms the sparkle on `primitive`-carrying fields (the consumer owns the actual platform call — the starter ships a labeled mock endpoint as the swap-point).

Every interactive element carries a `data-testid` (`row-<id>`, `card-<id>`, `col-<stage>`, `field-<key>`, `record-name`, `record-stage`, `fav-toggle`, `note-input`, `rel-<id>-<key>`, `group-by-<key>`, `file-input`, `file-row-<id>`, `file-dl-<id>`, `act-kind-<kind>`, `act-input`, `act-log`, `enrich-<key>`, `tl-ic-<kind>`, `chart-<obj>`, `bar-<option>` with `data-value`) — journeys assert on these, never on CSS classes.

## Contracts the consumer honors
- **Optimistic patch + reload-on-error:** apply the patch locally, call the API, reload truth on failure (the starter's ObjectView/RecordView are the reference).
- **Stable callback identities** into these components (`useCallback`) — an inline arrow recreated per render spins refetch loops (measured; the starter fixed it once so you don't have to).
- **API responses are never browser-cached** (`no-store`) — a cached list re-renders moved cards in their old column (measured).

## Extending
A new surface family (calendar view, gallery, tree) lands HERE as a sibling module reading the same `ObjectConfig` — never as a one-off inside an app. Add an OURS row in `scripts/gen-docs.mjs` + regenerate.
